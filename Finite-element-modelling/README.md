# Finite element modelling of trabeculation

Abaqus Standard (SIMULIA, Dessault Systemes) input files for the simulation of 5 consecutive cardiac cycles of the left ventricle, starting from the ventricular reference configuration (zero ventricular pressure). 

The two models are characterised by equal boundary conditions and total ventricular mass but different trabecular complexity. 
Low FD indicates the low fractal dimension case, High FD indicates the high fractal dimension case.
