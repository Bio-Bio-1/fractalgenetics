The examples here are anonymized Genscan datasets, labelled A-G.
They should be processed as follows:
- Acquisition Order = Apex to Base.
- Interpolation = x4.
- Blood pool pixel threshold = 50, but you can edit this.
- Connection percentage to myocardium = 50 % - this can also be edited.
- Discard end slices for summary statistics: Yes or No (the latter is the default).
