The examples here are anonymized Genscan datasets, labelled A-G.
They have been processed with the parameters:
- Acquisition Order = Apex to Base.
- Interpolation = x4.
- Blood pool pixel threshold = 50.
- Connection percentage to myocardium = 50 %.
- Discard end slices for summary statistics = No.
To re-process these samples yourself, you may change any of the parameters except the first.
